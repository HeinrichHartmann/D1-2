\begin{LGExecutiveSummary}
\vspace{10pt} 

In this deliverable we present several data mining methods that are
used to extract context information from the reality of citizens.  In
addition we report on the ongoing improvements to our sensor
collection architecture and communication interfaces.

The revised sensor collector provides improvements on recording
performance on low end devices, battery awareness and communication
interfaces. We present a newly designed sensor exchange format that
allows continues streaming of sensor information and implement a
streaming API for real time monitoring of mobile sensors.

We provide a Human Activity Recognition component that has been
trained to detect multiple activities of human ambulation (sitting,
standing, walking, running, cycling, stairs, lying). The classifier is
deployed on a mobile device, integrated into the toolkit architecture
and tested in the mobility field trial.  Furthermore, we have trained
several different machine learning models for this task and evaluated
the results against each other as well as against state of the art
classifiers. Our best classification accuracy remains with 84 \% still
below the reported accuracy of 97\% in the literature. We are
confident that we can improve our method quickly based on the built up
infrastructure.

The Service Line Detection component is capable of detecting the
precise service line used by a citizen based on the GPS sensor
information captured on the mobile device. The detection is performed
in a two-stage process that compares the received coordinates to
real-time GPS positions of public transportation vehicles and in a
second step to interpolated vehicle positions from time-table and
vehicle track data. Also this service is fully integrated into the
Live+Gov SaaS toolkit and has been successfully tested in the first
field trial.

The Traffic Jam Detection component is able to detect irregularities
in public transportation systems that provide real-time data about
vehicles. It has been integrated into the Live+Gov toolkit as part of
the Server Side Mining Service (C9). Although a thorough evaluation of
the detection quality is difficult to perform, a comparison to other
commercially available services shows promising results, with only
minor differences.

The sensor collector as well as other mobile components remain limited
to the Android platform. Despite several efforts, that are explained
in Section \ref{sec:cross_platform}, our prototypes based on a hybrid
cross-platform development framework were not be able to deliver the
intended results. Therefore, as described in D1.1, we have to fall
back on native development of the individual components on multiple
mobile platforms. 

In Section \ref{sec:DGM} we present research results on Distributed Geo
Matching, that allow to link social media posts (most importantly from
Twitter\footnote{\url{http://www.twitter.com}}) to vehicles of public
transportation that they originate from. The approach addresses the
problem of handling the high volume of incoming vehicle position
updates in a distributed computing architecture.

We conclude this deliverable with a report on Geographic Topic
Analysis in Section \ref{sec:GTA}. The presented method is able to
extract latent topics form reports of issues in the urban environment.
These topics take into account information about category of the
reported issue as well as geographic proximity. This new method was
shown to be superior to current state of the art geographic topic
models in the publication \cite{CCK1}.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:Introduction}

The ambition of the Live+Gov project is to develop applications for
closing the emerging gap between the citizens and the policy makers by
the help of mobile technologies. These applications provide enhanced
communication channels between the authorities and the citizens, which
facilitate increased transparency, direct participation and
opportunities for collaboration (cf. D2.1). 

In order to meet this goals Live+Gov makes use of the advanced
possibilities that are offered by moderns smart-phone devices which
are becoming widely available to the public. In particular, these
devices are equipped with a rich set of sensors, that allow to infer
information about the environment and context the citizen is currently
placed in. In this deliverable we present several data mining
techniques that allow to extract valuable context information from raw
sensor data. For instance, we recognize the current ambulation mode of
the user (e.g. walking or standing) in Section \ref{sec:HAR} and
detect the use of public transportation in Section \ref{sec:SLD}.
These data mining methods are implemented as generic services and
integrated into the Live+Gov toolkit as part of the Mobile Sensor
Mining Component (C15) and the Server Side Mining Service (C8)
(cf. Figure \ref{fig:toolkit}). The extracted context information can
be used to personalize the user experience (cf. WP3) of the use case
applications or analyze the behavior and service needs of the
citizens.

In this deliverable we also provide an improved and extended version
of the Mobile Sensor Collection Component (C14). The improvements
contain in particular enhancements of the communication interfaces. We
provide a new real-time streaming API as well as a revised sensor data
format (ssf) cf. Section \ref{sec:ssf}.

\section{Cross-Platform Development}
\label{sec:cross_platform}

In order to reach as many citizens as possible with our efforts, it is
important to have the mobile components available on multiple
platforms (e.g. Android, iOS). In deliverable D1.1 we have evaluated
different methods for mutiple platform sensor collection and reality
mining. The basic three possible pathways are (cf. D4.1):
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Native development} of all components for all platforms.
\item {\bf Web-based applications} exploit HTML5 and advanced APIs
  offered by mobile browsers to provide services on the mobile phone.
\item {\bf Hybrid development} uses native wrapper frameworks like
  PhoneGap\footnote{\url{http://phonegap.com/}} or
  Titanium\footnote{\url{http://www.appcelerator.com/}} that provide
  access to native platform and hardware features.
\end{enumerate}

The evaluation criteria included necessary sensor sampling
frequencies, native communication facilities and support for
background services. It was found, that the Titanium framework was
is able to fulfill all three requirements. On the basis of this
evaluation we proposed to implement the mobile reality mining 
services using this framework.

In due course we have started to implement prototypes of sensor
processing applications, such as the {\it
  TitaniumSensorCollector}-package which is provided alongside with
this deliverable.  It turned out, however, that it is not possible to
collect sensor data while running in the background with Titanium. Our
prior evaluation covered both requirements, but it was not tested if
it was cover both requirements at the same time. We were very
surprised to learn that those requirements cannot be met in parallel.

For the practical use of the component, the support for sensor
recordings in the background is very important. Indeed, the
classification of human activities is performed while the device is
worn in a pocket, in which case the display is typically switched
off and the application is running in the background.

As stated in D1.1, we propose independent {\bf native implementation}
as fallback solution in this case. Our initial development is focused
on the Android platform. Using a conversion toolkit we have been able
to port some components (e.g. the sensor collector) to Blackberry.
For support of iOS further development is necessary.

It has to be noted, that independent native development is associated
with high additional effort, as the development environments and APIs
are very different from each other. It has to be assessed if the
resources of the project shall be spent on this task, or rather in
improving the quality of the existing Android implementations.

In the view of these difficulties we have taken steps to reduce the
amount of computation performed on the mobile device. In analogy to
the image recognition task described in D3.1, it is possible to deploy
parts of the logic on a central server. Currently our Service Line
Detection component (c.f. section \ref{sec:SLD}) is implemented in
such a way, thereby paving the way for an iOS port of the Mobility
Field Trial Application. A similar solution is planned for the Human
Activity Recognition Component described in section \ref{sec:HAR}.

\chapter{Reality Mining Methods}

In this chapter we describe several reality mining methods that have
been developed in the Live+Gov project.

The first three methods Human Activity Recognition (Section~\ref{sec:HAR}),
Service Line Detection (Section~\ref{sec:SLD}) and Traffic Jam Detection
(Section~\ref{sec:TJD}) are fully implemented and tested in field trials.
The work on Distributed Geo-Matching (Section~\ref{sec:DGM}) and Geographical Topic
Analysis (Section~\ref{sec:GTA}) are of more scientific nature and have already
lead to a publication \cite{CCK1}.
