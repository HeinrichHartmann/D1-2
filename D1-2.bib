  title = {Clustering on the Unit Hypersphere using von {Mises}--{Fisher} Distributions},
  journal = {JMLR},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {1345-1382},
  abstract = {Several large scale data mining applications, such as text categorization
	and gene expression analysis, involve high-dimensional data that
	is also inherently directional in nature. Often such data is L2 normalized
	so that it lies on the surface of a unit hypersphere. Popular models
	such as (mixtures of) multi-variate Gaussians are inadequate for
	characterizing such data. This paper proposes a generative mixture-model
	approach to clustering directional data based on the von Mises-Fisher
	(vMF) distribution, which arises naturally for data distributed on
	the unit hypersphere. In particular, we derive and analyze two variants
	of the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework for estimating the
	mean and concentration parameters of this mixture. Numerical estimation
	of the concentration parameters is non-trivial in high dimensions
	since it involves functional inversion of ratios of Bessel functions.
	We also formulate two clustering algorithms corresponding to the
	variants of EM that we derive. Our approach provides a theoretical
	basis for the use of cosine similarity that has been widely employed
	by the information retrieval community, and obtains the spherical
	kmeans algorithm (kmeans with cosine similarity) as a special case
	of both variants. Empirical results on clustering of high-dimensional
	text and gene-expression data based on a mixture of vMF distributions
	show that the ability to estimate the concentration parameter for
	each vMF component, which is not present in existing approaches,
	yields superior results, especially for difficult clustering tasks
	in high-dimensional spaces.},

	mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context

	of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques

  abstract = {Traditionally multi-variate normal distributions have been the staple
	of data modeling in most domains. For some domains, the model they
	provide is either inadequate or incorrect because of the disregard
	for the directional components of the data. We present a generative
	model for data that is suitable for modeling directional data (as
	can arise in text and gene expression clustering). We use mixtures
	of von Mises-Fisher distributions to model our data since the von
	Mises-Fisher distribution is the natural distribution for directional
	data. We derive an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to ¯nd
	the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of our mixture
	model, and provide various experimental results to evaluate the \correctness"
	of our formulation. In this paper we also provide some of the mathematical
	background necessary to carry out all the derivations and to gain
	insight for an implementation},

	develops a form of theory which appears to be appropriate to measurements
	of position on a sphere. The primary problems of estimation as applied
	to the true direction, and the precision of observations, are discussed
	in the subcases which arise. The simultaneous distribution of the
	amplitude and direction of the vector sum of a number of random unit
	vectors of given precision, is demonstrated. From this is derived
	the test of significance appropriate to a worker whose knowledge
	of precision lies entirely in the internal evidence of the sample.
	This is the analogue of 'Student's' test in the Gaussian theory of
	errors. The general formulae obtained are illustrated using measurements
	of the direction of remanent magnetization in the directly and inversely
	magnetized lava flows obtained in Iceland by Mr J. Hospers.}},

  abstract = {{The problem of identifying subtle time-space clustering of disease,
	as may be occurring in leukemia, is described and reviewed. Published
	approaches, generally associated with studies of leukemia, not dependent
	on knowledge of the underlying population for their validity, are
	directed towards identifying clustering by establishing a relationship
	between the temporal and the spatial separations for the n(n - 1)/2
	possible pairs which can be formed from the n observed cases of disease.
	Here it is proposed that statistical power can be improved by applying
	a reciprocal transform to these separations. While a permutational
	approach can give valid probability levels for any observed association,
	for reasons of practicability, it is suggested that the observed
	association be tested relative to its permutational variance. Formulas
	and computational procedures for doing so are given.While the distance
	measures between points represent symmetric relationships subject
	to mathematical and geometric regularities, the variance formula
	developed is appropriate for arbitrary relationships. Simplified
	procedures are given for the case of symmetric and skew-symmetric
	relationships. The general procedure is indicated as being potentially
	useful in other situations as, for example, the study of interpersonal
	relationships. Viewing the procedure as a regression approach, the
	possibility for extending it to nonlinear and multivariate situations
	is suggested.Other aspects of the problem and of the procedure developed
	are discussed.Similarly, pure temporal clustering can be identified
	by a study of incidence rates in periods of widespread epidemics.
	In point of fact, many epidemics of communicable diseases are somewhat
	local in nature and so these do actually constitute temporal-spatial
	clusters. For leukemia and similar diseases in which cases seem to
	arise substantially at random rather than as clear-cut epidemics,
	it is necessary to devise sensitive and efficient procedures for
	detecting any nonrandom component of disease occurrence.Various ingenious
	procedures which statisticians have developed for the detection of
	disease clustering are reviewed here. These procedures can be generalized
	so as to increase their statistical validity and efficiency. The
	technic to be given below for imparting statistical validity to the
	procedures already in vogue can be viewed as a generalized form of
	regression with possible useful application to problems arising in
	quite different contexts.}},
